# Archer-C5V-modem-testing-utility
This program tests the turktelekom firmware version of Archer C5V type of modems, video above.
This is only working for Linux now. Windows version is on the way. I use debian 12 for this. To install dependencies to run this program are:

sudo apt install python3 python3-selenium python3-tk idle

For debian 11, you need to install pip then selenium then tk packages from pip.


It can grab the stats like wifi and stuff, but you need to check to code inside and change the location of where it saves all those data.
